Herein lies my proposed zero whole machine memory copy async file i/o and filesystem
library for Boost and the C++ standard, intended for storage devices with ~1 microsecond
4Kb transfer latencies and those supporting Storage Class Memory (SCM)/Direct Access
Storage (DAX). Its i/o overhead, including syscall overhead, has been benchmarked to
100 nanoseconds on Linux which corresponds to a theoretical maximum of 10M IOPS @ QD1,
approx 40Gb/sec per thread. It has particularly strong support for writing portable
filesystem algorithms which work well with directly mapped non-volatile storage such
as Intel Optane.

It is a complete rewrite after a Boost peer review in August 2015. Its github
source code repository lives at https://github.com/ned14/boost.afio.

- Portable to any conforming C++ 14 compiler with a working Filesystem TS in its STL.
- Will make use of any Concepts TS if you have them.
- `async_file_handle` supports `co_await` (Coroutines TS).
- Provides view adapters into the Ranges TS, so ready for STL2.
- Original error code is always preserved, even down to the original NT kernel error code if a NT kernel API was used.
- Race free filesystem design used throughout (i.e. no TOCTOU).
- Zero malloc, zero exception throw and zero whole system memory copy design used throughout, even down to paths (which can hit 64Kb!).
- Works very well with the C++ standard library, and is intended to be proposed for standardisation into C++ in Summer 2018.

\note Note that this code is of late alpha quality. It's quite reliable on Windows and Linux, but be careful when using it!

Examples of use:

These compilers and OS are regularly tested:
- GCC 7.0 (Linux 4,x x64)
- clang 4.0 (Linux 4.x x64)
- clang 5.0 (OS X 10.12 x64)
- Visual Studio 2017 (Windows 10 x64)

Other compilers, architectures and OSs may work, but are not tested regularly. You will need a Filesystem TS
implementation in your STL and C++ 14. See https://github.com/ned14/afio/blob/master/programs/fs-probe/fs_probe_results.yaml
for a database of latencies for various previously tested OS, filing systems and storage devices.

## v2 architecture and design implemented:

| NEW in v2 | Boost peer review feedback |     |
| --------- | -------------------------- | --- |
| ✔ | ✔ | Universal native handle/fd abstraction instead of `void *`.
| ✔ | ✔ | Perfectly/Ideally low memory (de)allocation per op (usually none).
| ✔ | ✔ | noexcept API throughout returning error_code for failure instead of throwing exceptions.
| ✔ | ✔ | AFIO v1 handle type split into hierarchy of types:<ol><li>handle - provides open, close, get path, clone, set/unset append only, change caching, characteristics<li>fs_handle - handles with an inode number<li>path_handle - a race free anchor to a subset of the filesystem<li>directory_handle - enumerates the filesystem<li>io_handle - adds synchronous scatter-gather i/o, byte range locking<li>file_handle - adds open/create file, get and set maximum extent<li>async_file_handle - adds asynchronous scatter-gather i/o<li>mapped_file_handle - adds low latency memory mapped scatter-gather i/o</ol>
| ✔ | ✔ | Cancelable i/o (made possible thanks to dropping XP support).
| ✔ | ✔ | All shared_ptr usage removed as all use of multiple threads removed.
| ✔ | ✔ | Use of std::vector to transport scatter-gather sequences replaced with C++ 20 `span<>` borrowed views.
| ✔ | ✔ | Completion callbacks are now some arbitrary type `U&&` instead of a future continuation. Type erasure for its storage is bound into the one single memory allocation for everything needed to execute the op, and so therefore overhead is optimal.
| ✔ | ✔ | Filing system algorithms made generic and broken out into public `afio::algorithms` template library (the AFIO FTL).
| ✔ | ✔ | Abstraction of native handle management via bitfield specified "characteristics".
| ✔ |   | Storage profiles, a YAML database of behaviours of hardware, OS and filing system combinations.
| ✔ |   | Absolute and interval deadline timed i/o throughout (made possible thanks to dropping XP support).
| ✔ |   | Dependency on ASIO/Networking TS removed completely.
| ✔ |   | Four choices of algorithm implementing a shared filing system mutex.
| ✔ |   | Uses CMake, CTest, CDash and CPack with automatic usage of C++ Modules or precompiled headers where available.
| ✔ |   | Far more comprehensive memory map and virtual memory facilities.
| ✔ |   | Much more granular, micro level unit testing of individual functions.
| ✔ |   | Much more granular, micro level internal logging of every code path taken.
| ✔ |   | Path views used throughout, thus avoiding string copying and allocation in `std::filesystem::path`.
| ✔ |   | Paths are equally interpreted as UTF-8 on all platforms.
| ✔ |   | We never store nor retain a path, as they are inherently racy and are best avoided.
| ✔ | ✔ | Parent handle caching is hard coded in, it is now an optional user applied templated adapter class.

Todo:

| NEW in v2 | Boost peer review feedback |     |
| --------- | -------------------------- | --- |
| ✔ |   | clang AST assisted SWIG bindings for other languages.
| ✔ |   | Statistical tracking of operation latencies so realtime IOPS can be measured.



## Planned features implemented:

| ✔ | ✔ |   | Win32 path support (260 path limit).
|   | ✔ |   | NT kernel path support (32,768 path limit).
| ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | Synchronous universal scatter-gather i/o.
| ✔ (POSIX AIO support) | ✔ | ✔ | Asynchronous universal scatter-gather i/o.
| ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | i/o deadlines and cancellation.
|   | ✔ | ✔ | Retrieving and setting the current maximum extent (size) of an open file.
|   | ✔ | ✔ | Retrieving the current path of an open file irrespective of where it has been renamed to by third parties.
|   | ✔ | ✔ | statfs_t ported over from AFIO v1.

| ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | `shared_fs_mutex` shared/exclusive entities locking based on memory maps
| ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | Universal portable UTF-8 path views.
|   | ✔ | ✔ | "Hole punching" and hole enumeration ported over from AFIO v1.
|   | ✔ | ✔ | Directory handles and very fast directory enumeration ported over from AFIO v1.
| ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | `shared_fs_mutex` shared/exclusive entities locking based on safe byte ranges
|   | ✔ | ✔ | Set random or sequential i/o (prefetch).
| ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | i/o on `async_file_handle` is coroutines awaitable.

| --------- | --------| ----- | --- |
|   |   |   | `symlink_handle`.
|   |   |   | BSD and OS X kqueues optimised `io_service`

Todo thereafter in order of priority:

| NEW in v2 | Windows | POSIX |     |
| --------- | --------| ----- | --- |
| ✔ |   |   | Page allocator based on an index of linked list of free pages. See notes.
| ✔ |   |   | Optionally concurrent B+ tree index based on page allocator for key-value store.
| ✔ |   |   | Attributes extending `span<buffers_type>` with DMA colouring.
| ✔ |   |   | Coroutine generator for iterating a file's contents in DMA friendly way.
| ✔ |   |   | Ranges & Concurrency based reliable directory hierarchy deletion algorithm.
| ✔ |   |   | Ranges & Concurrency based reliable directory hierarchy copy algorithm.
| ✔ |   |   | Ranges & Concurrency based reliable directory hierarchy update (two and three way) algorithm.
| ✔ |   |   | Linux KAIO support for native non-blocking `O_DIRECT` i/o
| ✔ |   |   | `std::pmr::memory_resource` adapting a file backing if on C++ 17.
| ✔ |   |   | Extended attributes support.
| ✔ |   |   | Algorithm to replace all duplicate content with hard links.
| ✔ |   |   | Algorithm to figure out all paths for a hard linked inode.
| ✔ |   |   | Algorithm to compare two or three directory enumerations and give differences. Probably blocked on the Ranges TS.

Features possibly to be added after a Boost peer review:
- Directory change monitoring.
- Permissions support (ACLs).
