Herein lies my proposed async file i/o and filesystem library for Boost and the C++ standard.
It is a complete rewrite after a Boost peer review in August 2015. Its github
source code repository lives at https://github.com/ned14/boost.afio.

\note Note that this code is of late alpha quality. It's quite reliable, but be careful when using it!

You need these compilers or better:
- GCC 7.0 (Linux)
- clang 4.0 (Linux)
- clang 5.0 (Windows)

Todo list for already implemented parts: https://ned14.github.io/afio/todo.html

To build and test (make, ninja etc):

~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
ctest -R afio_sl
~~~

To build and test (Visual Studio, XCode etc):

~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
ctest -C Release -R afio_sl
~~~

## v2 architecture and design implemented:

| NEW in v2 | Boost peer review feedback |     |
| --------- | -------------------------- | --- |
| ✔ | ✔ | Universal native handle/fd abstraction instead of `void *`.
| ✔ | ✔ | Perfectly/Ideally low memory (de)allocation per op (usually none).
| ✔ | ✔ | noexcept API throughout returning error_code for failure instead of throwing exceptions.
| ✔ | ✔ | AFIO v1 handle type split into hierarchy of types:<ol><li>handle - provides open, close, get path, clone, set/unset append only, change caching, characteristics<li>path_handle - a race free anchor to a subset of the filesystem<li>io_handle - adds synchronous scatter-gather i/o, byte range locking<li>file_handle - adds open/create file, get and set maximum extent<li>async_file_handle - adds asynchronous scatter-gather i/o</ol>
| ✔ | ✔ | Cancelable i/o (made possible thanks to dropping XP support).
| ✔ | ✔ | All shared_ptr usage removed as all use of multiple threads removed.
| ✔ | ✔ | Use of std::vector to transport scatter-gather sequences replaced with C++ 20 `span<>` borrowed views.
| ✔ | ✔ | Completion callbacks are now some arbitrary type `U&&` instead of a future continuation. Type erasure for its storage is bound into the one single memory allocation for everything needed to execute the op, and so therefore overhead is optimal.
| ✔ | ✔ | Filing system algorithms made generic and broken out into public `afio::algorithms` template library (the AFIO FTL).
| ✔ | ✔ | Abstraction of native handle management via bitfield specified "characteristics".
| ✔ |   | Storage profiles, a YAML database of behaviours of hardware, OS and filing system combinations.
| ✔ |   | Absolute and interval deadline timed i/o throughout (made possible thanks to dropping XP support).
| ✔ |   | Dependency on ASIO/Networking TS removed completely.
| ✔ |   | Four choices of algorithm implementing a shared filing system mutex.
| ✔ |   | Uses CMake, CTest, CDash and CPack with automatic usage of C++ Modules or precompiled headers where available.
| ✔ |   | Far more comprehensive memory map and virtual memory facilities.
| ✔ |   | Much more granular, micro level unit testing of individual functions.
| ✔ |   | Much more granular, micro level internal logging of every code path taken.
| ✔ |   | Path views used throughout, thus avoiding string copying and allocation in `std::filesystem::path`.
| ✔ |   | Paths are equally interpreted as UTF-8 on all platforms.
| ✔ |   | We never store nor retain a path, as they are inherently racy and are best avoided.

Todo:

| NEW in v2 | Boost peer review feedback |     |
| --------- | -------------------------- | --- |
| ✔ |   | clang AST assisted SWIG bindings for other languages.
| ✔ |   | Statistical tracking of operation latencies so realtime IOPS can be measured.



## Planned features implemented:
