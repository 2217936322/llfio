/*! \struct stat_t
\brief Metadata about a directory entry

This structure looks somewhat like a `struct stat`, and indeed it was derived from BSD's `struct stat`.
However there are a number of changes to better interoperate with modern practice, specifically:

- inode value containers are forced to 64 bits.
- Timestamps use C++11's `std::chrono::system_clock::time_point` or Boost equivalent. The resolution
of these may or may not equal what a `struct timespec` can do depending on your STL.
- The type of a file, which is available on Windows and on POSIX without needing an additional
syscall, is provided by `st_type` which is one of the values from `filesystem::file_type`.
- As type is now separate from permissions, there is no longer a `st_mode`, instead being a
`st_perms` which is solely the permissions bits. If you want to test permission bits in `st_perms`
but don't want to include platform specific headers, note that `filesystem::perms` contains
definitions of the POSIX permissions flags.
- The st_sparse and st_compressed flags indicate if your file is sparse and/or compressed, or if
the directory will compress newly created files by default. Note that on POSIX, a file is sparse
if and only if st_allocated < st_size which can include compressed files if that filing system is mounted
with compression enabled (e.g. ZFS with ZLE compression which elides runs of zeros).
- The st_reparse_point is a Windows only flag and is never set on POSIX, even on a NTFS volume.
