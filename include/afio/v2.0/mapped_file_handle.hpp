All the major OSs on all the major 64 bit CPU architectures now offer at least 127 Tb of address
spaces to user mode processes. This makes feasible mapping multi-Tb files directly into
memory, and thus avoiding the syscall overhead involved when reading and writing. This
becames **especially** important with next-gen storage devices capable of Direct Access
Storage (DAX) like Optane from 2018 onwards, performance via syscalls will always be
but a fraction of speaking directly to the storage device via directly mapped memory.

As an example of the gains, on Microsoft Windows to read or write 1Kb using the standard
syscalls takes about fifteen times longer than the exact same i/o via mapped memory. On Linux,
OS X or FreeBSD the gain is considerably lower, a 1Kb i/o might only be 50% slower via syscalls
than memory maps. However for lots of say 64 byte i/o, the gain of memory maps over
syscalls is unsurpassable.

This class combines a `file_handle` with a `section_handle` and a `map_handle` to
implement a fully memory mapped `file_handle`. The whole file is always mapped entirely
into memory, and `read()` and `write()` i/o is performed directly with the map.
Reads always return the original mapped data, and do not fill any buffers passed in.
For obvious reasons the utility of this class on 32-bit systems is limited,
but can be useful when used with smaller files.

Note that zero length files cannot be memory mapped, and writes past the maximum
extent do NOT auto-extend the size of the file, rather the data written beyond the maximum valid
extent has undefined kernel-specific behaviour, which includes segfaulting. You must therefore always
`truncate(newsize)` to resize the file and its maps before you can read or write to it,
and be VERY careful to not read or write beyond the maximum extent of the file.

Therefore, when a file is created or is otherwise of zero length, `address()` will return
a null pointer. Similarly, calling `truncate(0)` will close the map and section handles,
they will be recreated on next truncation to a non-zero size.

For better performance when handling files which are growing, there is a concept of
"address space reservation" via `reserve()` and `capacity()`, which on some kernels
is automatically and efficiently expanded into when the underlying file grows.
The implementation asks the
kernel to set out a contiguous region of pages matching that reservation, and to map the
file into the beginning of the reservation. The remainder of the pages may be inaccessible
and may generate a segfault, or they may automatically reflect any growth in the underlying
file. This is why `read()` and `write()` only know about the reservation size, and will read
and write memory up to that reservation size, without checking if the memory involved exists
or not yet. You are guaranteed that `address()` will not return a new
value unless you truncate from a bigger length to a smaller length, or you call `reserve()`
with a new reservation.

`length()` reports the last truncated length of the mapped file (possibly by any process in
the system) up to the reservation limit, NOT the length of the underlying file.
When you know that another process has extended the file and you wish to map the newly appended
data, you can call `update_map()` which guarantees that the mapping your
process sees is up to date, rather than relying on any kernel-specific automatic mapping.
Whether automatic or enforced by `update_map()`, the reservation limit will not be exceeded
nor will `address()` suddenly return something different.

It is thus up to you to detect that the reservation has been exhausted, and to
reserve a new reservation which will change the value returned by `address()`. This
entirely manual system is a bit tedious and cumbersome to use, but as mapping files
is an expensive operation given TLB shootdown, we leave it up to the end user to decide
when to expend the cost of mapping.

\warning You must be cautious when the file is being extended by third parties which are
not using this `mapped_file_handle` to write the new data. With unified page cache kernels,
mixing mapped and normal i/o is generally safe except at the end of a file where race
conditions and outright kernel bugs tend to abound. To avoid these, solely and exclusively
use a dedicated handle configured to atomic append only to do the appends.

Automatic mapping of growing files on various kernels:
<dl>
<dt>Microsoft Windows</dt>
<dd>For the current Terminal Services Session, the first `mapped_file_handle::truncate()` or
`mapped_file_handle::update_map()` by any process update maps in all processes simultaneously.
Other methods for extending the file will require a `mapped_file_handle::update_map()`
by any process per Terminal Services Session to synchronise.
</dd>
<dt>Linux</dt>
<dd>The Linux kernel automatically maps newly appended data to a file into all over extended
maps of that file. `mapped_file_handle::length()` will continue to return the old value until
`mapped_file_handle::update_map()` is called to refresh it.
</dd>
<dt>FreeBSD</dt>
<dd>?</dd>
<dt>Apple MacOS</dt>
<dd>?</dd>
</dl>

Automatic mapping of shrinking files on various kernels:
<dl>
<dt>Microsoft Windows</dt>
<dd>All maps and open section handles on the file anywhere in the system must be removed before
any shrinkage of a file is permitted.</dd>
<dt>Linux</dt>
<dd>Data written after the maximum extent up to the page boundary appears to be zeroed on flush
and any pages thereafter appear to be unmapped. Just to be safe, on all POSIX platforms
`mapped_file_handle::truncate()` specifically
undirties any pages about to be freed on newer kernels, or specifically deallocates them from
memory and physical storage on older kernels before doing the file shrink. This ensures
truncated pages don't get zombified.

is for backing shared memory maps).
