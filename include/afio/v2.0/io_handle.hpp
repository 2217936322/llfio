  /*! \brief Tries to lock the range of bytes specified for shared or exclusive access. Be aware this passes through
  the same semantics as the underlying OS call, including any POSIX insanity present on your platform:

  - Any fd closed on an inode must release all byte range locks on that inode for all
  other fds. If your OS isn't new enough to support the non-insane lock API, `flag::byte_lock_insanity` will be set
  in flags() after the first call to this function.
  - Threads replace each other's locks, indeed locks replace each other's locks.

  You almost cetainly should use your choice of an `algorithm::shared_fs_mutex::*` instead of this
  as those are more portable and performant.

  \warning This is a low-level API which you should not use directly in portable code. Another issue is that
  atomic lock upgrade/downgrade, if your platform implements that (you should assume it does not in
  portable code), means that on POSIX you need to *release* the old `extent_guard` after creating a new one over the
  same byte range, otherwise the old `extent_guard`'s destructor will simply unlock the range entirely. On
  Windows however upgrade/downgrade locks overlay, so on that platform you must *not* release the old
  `extent_guard`. Look into `algorithm::shared_fs_mutex::safe_byte_ranges` for a portable solution.

  \return An extent guard, the destruction of which will call unlock().
  \param offset The offset to lock. Note that on POSIX the top bit is always cleared before use
  as POSIX uses signed transport for offsets. If you want an advisory rather than mandatory lock
  on Windows, one technique is to force top bit set so the region you lock is not the one you will
  i/o - obviously this reduces maximum file size to (2^63)-1.
  \param bytes The number of bytes to lock. Zero means lock the entire file using any more
  efficient alternative algorithm where available on your platform (specifically, on BSD and OS X use
  flock() for non-insane semantics).
  \param exclusive Whether the lock is to be exclusive.
  \param d An optional deadline by which the lock must complete, else it is cancelled.
  \errors Any of the values POSIX fcntl() can return, `errc::timed_out`, `errc::not_supported` may be
  returned if deadline i/o is not possible with this particular handle configuration (e.g.
  non-overlapped HANDLE on Windows).

buffer is updated with the number of bytes of that buffer barriered.
\param self The object whose member function to call.
\param reqs A scatter-gather and offset request for what range to barrier. May be ignored on some platforms
which always write barrier the entire file. Supplying a default initialised reqs write barriers the entire file.
\param wait_for_device True if you want the call to wait until data reaches storage and that storage
has acknowledged the data is physically written. Slow.
\param and_metadata True if you want the call to sync the metadata for retrieving the writes before the
barrier after a sudden power loss event. Slow.
\param d An optional deadline by which the i/o must complete, else it is cancelled.
Note function may return significantly after this deadline if the i/o takes long to cancel.
\errors Any of the values POSIX fdatasync() or Windows NtFlushBuffersFileEx() can return.
\mallocs None.
