/*! \class path_handle
\brief A handle to somewhere originally identified by a path on the filing system. Typically used
as the lightest weight handle to some location on the filing system which may
unpredictably relocate over time. This handle is thus an *anchor* to a subset island of the
filing system, free of any race conditions introduced by third party changes to any part
of the path leading to that island.
